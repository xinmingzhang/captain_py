# Planet Hopper

this file is for [Reddit Pygame Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/4qcgmd/challenge_planet_hopper/)

  - You can download this file to replace the captain.py file or just copy the code and paste in it
  - I have tested it in Python 3 and Python 2

Bugs:
  - I write an method to check ai reach the goal, however, sometimes it failed
  - I tried to fix it, however, I failed

I allocate the resources averagely on each planet, so it confirm no one dies.I considering that I should not carry any passangers at first, because if colonists on ship they won't make anything. Then any planet which reach the goals,  it should be transfered people into  another planet, and because we do not care food, hence at proper time, transfer the food planet people.I am not sure I have taken roundabout ways in this algorithm. so if you have any suggestions, please tell me and i would be very glad ^ v ^
